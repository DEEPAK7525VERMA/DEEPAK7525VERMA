# Hi, I’m Deepak 👋

I’m a final-year Computer Science & Engineering student who enjoys **building things**, breaking them, and then understanding *why* they broke.

I learn best by experimenting with real codebases, not just tutorials.

---

## 🧠 What I’m focused on right now
- Learning **Spring Boot** and backend design
- Strengthening **DSA & problem-solving**
- Writing cleaner, more readable code
- Understanding how real-world systems are structured

---

## 🛠️ Tech I’ve worked with
- **Languages:** C++, Java, Python  
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (learning), REST APIs  
- **Mobile:** Flutter  
- **CS Fundamentals:** DSA, OOP, DBMS basics  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Linux basics

---

## 🧩 How I learn
- I fork repositories and experiment
- I prefer small, focused projects over big unfinished ones
- I debug slowly and deliberately
- I believe consistency beats motivation

---

## 🚀 Goals
- Become a solid backend engineer
- Crack good placements through fundamentals + projects
- Build software that actually solves problems
- Keep improving, even on days motivation is low

## 🎸 Outside code
- Guitar (on and off, but always comes back)
- Boxing & tennis
- Thinking deeply about things most people ignore

## 📌 A small note
This GitHub is a **learning log**, not a highlight reel.  
Some repos are messy. Some ideas are half-baked.  
That’s intentional — growth happens there.

Thanks for stopping by.
